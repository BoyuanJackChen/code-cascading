When he plants a tree, he will get 3 fruits that will grow to become trees in days $t_0$, $t_1$, $t_2$. Then, he will gather the fruits from the tree he planted, at day $t_0$, day $t_1$ and day $t_2$. He will only be able to harvest fruits from trees he planted before those. He can plant a tree that will grow to become tree in days $d_0$, $d_1$ and $d_2$. Then, he will gather the fruits from the tree he planted in days $d_0$, $d_1$ and $d_2$.
