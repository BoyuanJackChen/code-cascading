Given the string that represents the total number of \r\n    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits \r\n    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.\r\n    for examble:\r\n    fruit_distribution(\"5 apples and 6 oranges\", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8\r\n    fruit_distribution(\"0 apples and 1 oranges\",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2\r\n    fruit_distribution(\"2 apples and 3 oranges\", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95\r\n    fruit_distribution(\"100 apples and 1 oranges\",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    apples = int(s.split()[0])\r\n    oranges = int(s.split()[2])\r\n    mango = n - apples - oranges\r\n    return mango\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. The function takes two arguments: `s` and `n`.\r\n2. The string `s` represents the total number of apples and oranges in the basket.\r\n3. The integer `n` represents the total number of fruits in the basket.\r\n4. The function splits the string `s` into two parts: the number of apples and the number of oranges.\r\n5. The function converts the number of apples and oranges from strings to integers.\r\n6. The function calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.\r\n7. The function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of how to use the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"5 apples and 6 oranges\", 19)) # Output: 8\r\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"0 apples and 1 oranges\", 3)) # Output: 2\r\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"2 apples and 3 oranges\", 100)) # Output: 95\r\nprint(fruit_distribution(\"100 apples and 1 oranges\", 120)) # Output: 19\r\n``` "}

The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the row and column of the integer `x` in the list.\r\n\r\nThe function first initializes an empty list `result`. It then iterates over each row in the list using the `enumerate` function. For each row, it checks if the integer `x` is present in the row using the `in` operator. If `x` is present in the row, it gets the index of `x` in the row using the `index` method of lists. It then appends a tuple containing the row index and the column index of `x` to the `result` list.\r\n\r\nAfter iterating over all the rows, the function sorts the `result` list first by rows in ascending order using the `sort` method. Then, it sorts the rows of the list by columns in descending order using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the key. The lambda function returns the second element of the tuple, which is the column index of the integer `x`. Finally, the function returns the sorted `result` list.\r\n\r\nThe function works as expected for the given examples. "}

The function initializes a variable `max_so_far` to the first element of the input list. It then iterates through the input list, updating the `max_so_far` variable with the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `max_so_far` value. This ensures that the `max_so_far` variable always contains the maximum element found so far in the input list. Finally, the function appends the current value of `max_so_far` to the `rolling_max_list` and returns it. "}

The function first initializes an empty list `collatz_sequence` to store the collatz sequence for the given number `n`. It then enters a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it divides it by 2. If `n` is odd, it multiplies it by 3 and adds 1. The loop continues until `n` becomes 1. At this point, the function appends all the odd numbers in the `collatz_sequence` to the `odd_numbers` list. Finally, the function returns the sorted `odd_numbers` list. "}

It first splits the sentence into words using the `split` method, and then iterates through each word in the sentence.

Finally, it joins the prime words into a single string using the `join` method and returns it.\r\n\r\nThe `is_prime` function takes a number as input and returns `True` if it is prime, and `False` otherwise. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive), checking if any of them divide the number evenly. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime. "}

It returns an integer value that represents the number of times the `substring` can be found in the `string`. The function uses a while loop to iterate through the `string` and checks if the current substring matches the `substring`. If it does, the count is incremented and the loop continues to the next substring. If it doesn't, the loop continues to the next character in the `string`. The loop continues until the end of the `string` is reached. Finally, the function returns the count of the number of times the `substring` can be found in the `string`. "}

The function first calculates the mean of the input numbers and then calculates the sum of absolute differences between each number and the mean. Finally, it returns the average of these differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation. "}

It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of three elements in the list and checks if their sum is zero. If it finds a triple that sums to zero, it returns True. If it iterates through all possible combinations without finding a triple that sums to zero, it returns False. "}
