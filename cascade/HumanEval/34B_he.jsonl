The first four numbers of the sequence are defined as follows:\r\n\r\n- fib4(0) = 0\r\n- fib4(1) = 0\r\n- fib4(2) = 2\r\n- fib4(3) = 0\r\n\r\nFor any n > 3, we can compute the n-th number of the sequence by adding the four preceding numbers. We can use a list to store the preceding four numbers and compute the next number by adding them together. We start with the first four numbers of the sequence and then compute the next numbers until we reach the n-th number.\r\n\r\nThe function first checks if n is equal to 0, 1, 2, or 3, and returns the corresponding value. For any n > 3, it initializes a list with the first four numbers of the sequence and then uses a loop to compute the next numbers until it reaches the n-th number. The loop starts at 4 and goes up to n+1, because we need to compute the n-th number and the list needs to have n+1 elements. Inside the loop, we compute the next number by adding the four preceding numbers and append it to the list. Finally, we return the n-th element of the list, which is the n-th number of the Fib4 sequence. "}

It does this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string, and then using the `ord` and `chr` functions to convert the character to its ASCII code and back to a character, respectively. The ASCII code for a lowercase letter is the sum of the ASCII code for \"a\" and the position of the letter in the alphabet (0 for \"a\", 1 for \"b\", etc.). So, to shift a character by 5 positions, we add 5 to its ASCII code, take the result modulo 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to handle wraparound, and then add the ASCII code for \"a\" back to get the shifted character's ASCII code. Finally, we use the `join` method to join the list of shifted characters back into a string.\r\n\r\nThe `decode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the decoded string. It does this by using a similar list comprehension to the `encode_shift` function, but with a negative shift of 5 instead of a positive shift. This means that we subtract 5 from the ASCII code for each character, take the result modulo 26 to handle wraparound, and then add the ASCII code for \"a\" back to get the original character's ASCII code. We then use the `join` method to join the list of original characters back into a string. "}

The function first splits the input string into groups of nested parentheses using the `split()` method. It then iterates over each group and calls the `max_depth` function to find the maximum depth of nesting for that group. The `max_depth` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer representing the maximum depth of nesting for the parentheses in that string. It does this by iterating over each character in the string and keeping track of the current depth of nesting using a `depth` variable. It updates the `max_depth` variable whenever the current depth exceeds it. Finally, the `parse_nested_parens` function returns the list of maximum depths for each group. "}

If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, it means that there is no matching opening bracket, so the function returns `False`.

The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input.\r\n2. The first step is to convert the integer `N` to its binary representation using the built-in `bin` function. The `bin` function returns a string with a prefix `0b`, so we slice the string from index 2 to get the binary representation without the prefix.\r\n3. Next, we calculate the sum of digits in the binary string using a generator expression and the built-in `sum` function. We convert each digit to an integer using the `int` function before summing them up.\r\n4. Finally, we convert the sum of digits to its binary representation using the `bin` function and return the binary string without the prefix.\r\n\r\nNote: The function assumes that the input integer `N` is within the specified constraints (0 \u2264 N \u2264 10000).

It does this by iterating through the rest of the list using another `for` loop and counting the number of times the duplicate appears. If the count is greater than 1, then the function returns `False`. If the count is 1 or less, then the function continues iterating through the list.\r\n\r\nIf the function reaches the end of the list without finding any out-of-order elements or more than 1 duplicates of the same number, then the list is sorted and the function returns `True`.

If the digit is even, the `even_count` variable is incremented by 1. If the digit is odd, the `odd_count` variable is incremented by 1.\r\n6. Finally, a tuple containing the `even_count` and `odd_count` variables is returned. "}

It uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three elements in the list and checks if their sum is equal to zero. If it finds a triplet that sums to zero, it returns True. If it iterates over all possible combinations without finding a triplet that sums to zero, it returns False. "}
